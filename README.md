Employee Profile Management System
This Python script is designed to manage employee details using provided salary data from a Kaggle dataset. It includes functionality to import data, process it into a Python dictionary, retrieve employee details, handle errors, and export employee details to a CSV file within a zipped folder named 'Employee Profile.'

Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
zipfile
csv
Installation
Install Python from the official website: Python Downloads.
Install required packages using pip
Usage
Import the necessary libraries at the beginning of your Python script:
Copy and paste the provided code into your Jupyter Notebook.
Run the script to perform the following operations:

Import the salary data from the provided Kaggle URL.
Define a function to retrieve employee details by name.
Validate if the imported file contains data from Kaggle.
Process the salary data into a Python dictionary.
Handle errors when retrieving employee details.
Export employee details to a CSV file within a zipped folder named 'Employee Profile.'
Validate if the exported file contains data from Kaggle.
Functions
get_employee_details(name): Retrieves employee details by name from the imported salary data.

validate_kaggle_data(file_path): Validates if the provided file contains data from the specified Kaggle URL.

Output
Upon running the script, the employee details will be exported to a CSV file (employee_details.csv) within a zipped folder named 'Employee Profile' (Employee Profile.zip). The script will print messages indicating the export status and whether the exported file contains data from Kaggle.



Employee Profile Data Analysis in R
This R script is designed to analyze employee details exported from a Python script using salary data. It includes functionality to unzip the exported folder, read the CSV file containing employee details, and display the data.

Requirements
R programming language
Usage
Ensure that you have R installed on your system. You can download it from the official website: R Project.

Place the exported zip file, 'Employee Profile.zip,' in the same directory as your R script or set the working directory to the location of the zip file.

Copy and paste the provided code into your R script or RStudio environment.

Run the script to perform the following operations:

Unzip the 'Employee Profile.zip' folder.
Read the CSV file ('employee_details.csv') containing employee details.
Display the data from the CSV file.
Functions
unzip("Employee Profile.zip"): Unzips the 'Employee Profile.zip' folder to access the CSV file.

read.csv("Employee Profile/employee_details.csv"): Reads the CSV file ('employee_details.csv') containing employee details into an R data frame.

Output
Upon running the script, the employee data will be displayed in the R console or environment, allowing you to perform further analysis and visualization as needed.
